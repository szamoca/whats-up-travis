# WHAT'S UP TRAVIS?

> This is a small project with quite a simple purpose: to practise the configuration of a React application without the create-react-app CLI.

## The Simple Purpose

Main goals of W.U.T. were/are to:
- configure app in `webpack.config.js` and `.babelrc`
- add scripts in `package.json`
- add a linter with eslint in `.eslintrc.js`
- integrate React testing with scripts as well
- integrate Travis CI
